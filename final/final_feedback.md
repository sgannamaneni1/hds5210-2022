# Feedback on Final

Overall, I think you did a good job demonstrating most of the skills we learned this semester.  I could have used a little bit more narrative explanation throughout the project, explaining more about WHY you were taking the steps you were taking.

Some of the visualizations you chose to include weren't very helpful. When there are many, many categories and the labels are illegible, you need to find a different want to communicate your point.
